# UnityVSTHost
VST plugin host for Unity engine. Supports 64bit VST2 plugins on Windows only. Does not support MIDI input to plugins at this stage.

Note that the C++ Dll code can be found here: https://github.com/Chris-TopherW/UnityVSTDll 

Warning: this code was part of my grad research in 2016 and is a dumpster fire, enter at your own peril.
