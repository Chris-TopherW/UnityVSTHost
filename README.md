# UnityVSTHost
VST plugin host for Unity engine. Supports 64bit VST2 plugins on Windows only. Does not support MIDI input to plugins at this stage.

Note that this was my grad research code and it was hacky when I wrote it a couple of years ago, and I've done a poor (no) job of maintaining it sorry! So I can't guarantee that it does anything.
