Readme:
This is an alpha release of VSTHost by Chris Wratt as part of the
completion of their Masters of Engineering degree at Victoria University,
Wellington.
Currently the plugin supports 64 bit VST2 effect loading on Windows machines
and allows the user to build these into their applications. The plugin does
not support loading 32 bit plugins, VST3 plugins, or VST instruments that require
midi input (hopefully all of these features will be added in the future).
-----------Loading 64 bit VST instrument plugins will crash the editor---------------
